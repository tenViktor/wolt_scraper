## 📝 Final Note
The purpose of this project was to analyze a Wolt venue’s offerings, not to create a perfect or production-level codebase. Given the tight time frame, I utilized **generative AI tools** (such as **ChatGPT** and **ClaudeAI**) to expedite certain tasks and improve efficiency.

As a result, I do not claim **100% sole authorship** of the code, acknowledging the contributions made through the use of AI assistance.
